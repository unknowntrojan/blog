I'm **unknowntrojan**. I'm **20 years old**, go by **he/him** and spend my days with **RE**, **gamehacking** and **Rust**. You can find my **socials** at the **bottom of the page**.

As a kid I was fascinated by Computers. So I got into programming as early as I could. I started with **C**, later **C++**, and then diversified my knowledge over time.

3 years ago I learned **Rust** at the recommendation of a friend, and **I'm never going back**. The experience has been freeing and blissful. Never before have I loved programming as much as I do now. You can expect me to shill **Rust** on here in almost every post.

Around 2016 I started to get into **gamehacking**. There's something about the instant feedback loop of trying to break a game and seeing what happens. Trying to find things that would make me and my friends laugh was always a rewarding experience.

**RE** is an integral part of **gamehacking**, so I started learning it around this time. I also got into **CTFs** as well.

Have a look around and see what you like!
